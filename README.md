## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Websites exist to assist with monitoring Dark Net threat actor activity, a Twitter/X bot also exists [@RansomwareNews](https://twitter.com/RansomwareNews) however I've not seen a working Discord bot. The purpose of this application is to allow IR/SOC/Threat hunters and intelligence teams receive Discord notifications when a new victim is published.

## 💭 How it works <a name = "working"></a>

The bot reads responses from a HTTP API. When the Threat Actors "leak" site is modified, the data is parsed by the bot and then forwarded into a Discord channel.
